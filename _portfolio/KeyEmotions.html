<p>
    Generative music is defined as music created through algorithms capable of producing compositions autonomously. In recent years, this technology has become a valuable tool for musicians and composers in their creative process. In this context, the present Master's Thesis develops a deep learning model capable of generating symbolic music, adapting its creation according to the quadrants of Russell's model of emotions.
</p>
<p>
    In this project, following a workflow based on a machine learning pipeline, the process spans from the creation of a MIDI dataset labeled with emotions to its analysis and processing, extracting the key musical features needed to train the model. Additionally, an autoregressive transformer model based on a decoder is designed, trained, and evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics to generate music conditioned by emotions.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, this study explores the ethical and legal implications of AI-generated music, addressing issues such as authorship, creativity and originality, copyright, and cultural appropriation, among others.
