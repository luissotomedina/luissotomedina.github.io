    This master's thesis presents the development of an emotion-conditioned symbolic music generation system based on Russell's circumplex model. The research follows a machine learning pipeline methodology, which includes: 
    <ul>
        <li>Data collection and annotation</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing & feature engineering</li>
        <li>Model architecture design</li>
        <li>Model training and optimization</li>
        <li>Quantitative and qualitative evaluation</li>
    </ul>
    The work also confronts critical ethical and legal questions in generative AI: <em>Can AI systems be truly creative? Who holds rights to AI-generated musical compositions?</em>
