Here is Luis.

I'm a Telecommunications Engineer with an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in acoustic data analysis, modeling, and machine learning. With nearly four years of experience using programming as a core problem-solving tool, I focus on turning complex, real-world challenges into data-driven solutions.

I'm particularly interested in generative AI and the practical application of machine learning. I enjoy designing and building end-to-end software solutions, combining clean code with efficient, scalable systems. I'm a motivated, organized, and responsible team player, always curious and excited to dive into tough problems and find creative solutions through data-driven technologies.

If you're interested in my work or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me at [luissoto.personal@gmail.com](mailto:luissoto.personal@gmail.com).
